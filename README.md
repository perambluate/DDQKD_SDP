# DDQKD_SDP
Compute key rate with semidefinite program (SDP) for device-dependent protocol based on Mateus AraÃºjo's paper (arXiv:2211.05725). The package is written in Julia with Convex (https://jump.dev/Convex.jl/stable/) as an interface for semidefinite programs. The scripts for BB84, B92, and DM CV QKD are provided as examples.

## Prerequisite
### Julia packages
#### @DDQKD_aroujo
- Convex
- MathOptInterface
- FastGaussQuadrature
- QuantumInformation
- LinearAlgebra
- SCS
- MosekTools (optional)

> Julia packages Installation
> For registered Julia packages, one can using the commands
> ```Julia
> using Pkg
> Pkg.update()
> Pkg.add("Convex")
> ```
> For unregistered packages, one needs to use the package name with extension `.jl` such as `QuantumInformation.jl` instead of `QuantumInformation`.

#### @DataSaver
- DelimitedFiles
#### @Other scripts
- Combinatorics
- Printf

### SDP Solvers (optional)
- Mosek

> `SCS` and `MosekTools` are two of the solvers which can be used with `Convex` interface. `SCS` packages includes the executable files, while `MosekTools` is only an interface to Mosek, one needs to install Mosek separately.

## Installation
To use this package, one can either install via `Pkg` or download this repo directly.
### Install with `Pkg`
In Julia interface type `]`, you should see
```
(v1.1) pkg>
```

Then install package with `add`
```
(v1.1) pkg> add https://github.com/perambluate/DDQKD_SDP.jl
```

### Download from GitHub
#### With `git` command
```bash
git clone https://github.com/perambluate/DDQKD_SDP.git
```
#### Download as zip
In the GitHub repo page, click `< >code` bottom, and you will see `Download ZIP`.
